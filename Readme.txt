A scheduling algorithm is a computer program that determines how a computer system or processor allocates resources, such as CPU time, memory, and disk space, among various competing processes or tasks. 
The primary goal of a scheduling algorithm is to optimize the utilization of resources while minimizing the response time, waiting time, and turnaround time of processes.
List of scheduling algorithms are as follows:

First-come, first-served scheduling (FCFS) algorithm
Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJF) algorithm
Shortest Remaining time (SRT) algorithm
Non-preemptive priority Scheduling algorithm
Preemptive priority Scheduling algorithm
Round-Robin Scheduling algorithm
Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN) algorithm
Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling algorithm
Multilevel Queue Scheduling algorithm

A searching algorithm is a procedure used to find a specific element within a collection of data. 
The most common type of searching algorithm is the linear search, also known as sequential search. 
Another type of searching algorithm is the binary search. Binary search is more efficient than linear search, especially for large collections.
